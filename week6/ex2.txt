I compared 2 algorithms by some tests, but here would be the most interesting cases:

Case 1:
Input
3
0
1000
0
204
4
41

The first algorithm completed these 3 processes sequentially with no breaks as well as the second did. But there is
one difference - the first one first complete the hardest process, which takes 1000 ticks, while the second one firstly
finished the second process and then the third, which were smaller.

Case 2:
Input
3
1
1
10
20
3
5

The first algorithm wasted time in ticks 2 - 10, because it cannot take the third process before the second one.
But the second algorithm complete firstly the third tasks, which was ready in the 3rd tick, thus the second algorithm
was faster.
