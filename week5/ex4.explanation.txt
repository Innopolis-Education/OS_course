The time taken for the calculating is the same when we execute the process from the ex3 and ex4 with 1 thread only.
But others processes takes more time than the same number of threads from ex3.
It is because in the ex3 we run some threads in parallel, but in the ex4 we run it dependently, thus, some threads are
waiting sometimes to continue the execution, but threads from ex3 did not waste time on sleeping.
