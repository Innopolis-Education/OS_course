A physical address is address to the real memory cell. It describes allocation of the cell with memory.
A virtual address is abstract address, which describes allocation of the process' address space.
If the physical address refers to the real memory data, then the virtual address refers to the memory of the process,
i.e. it may be not only one data from the real memory.
