To increase number of hits, we just can to print sequence of same numbers, for example, 1, 1, 1.... and infinite number of times.
Thus, even if the page frame's size would be 1, the hit ratio would be approximately 99% (only 1 miss will be in this case).

If we want to decrease hit ratio, we can increase number of distinct numbers in the sequence. For example: 1, 2, ... 1000.
In this case miss ratio would be 100% and hit ratio is 0%.
